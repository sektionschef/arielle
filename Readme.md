# Medusa

“Nunc, o fortissime, fare, precor, Perseu, quanta virtute quibusque artibus abstuleris crinita draconibus ora!”
Ovid - Metamorphoses Book IV, 769
"Perseus, I beg you to tell us by what prowess and by what arts you carried off that head with snakes for hair."

Medusa is built in 3D with p5.js using physics of oimo.js (see LICENSE.md).

I am afraid that's all there is to say.
